3 versions, one for 1.12.2 and below, one for 1.13-1.16, and WIP one for 1.17+

1.12.2 and below: Most if not all of the blocks done, this version finished.
1.13-1.16 A few missing, might update later.

Currently working on adding more blocks for versions 1.17-1.19+, as well as updating some of the textures.
